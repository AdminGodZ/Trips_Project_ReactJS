## 🔧 Project Setup

To start the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed.

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd biztrips-app
npm install

```

Start the React application:

```bash
npm start
```

## 📋 Requirements

The BizTrips application must meet the following requirements:

1. **Apply all HTTP request methods (CRUD)**
2. **Design and build the website**
3. **Use forms and validate them**
4. **Apply styling and layout**
5. **Deploy the web application**

## 📂 Use Cases

The application should handle at least three use cases, such as:

1. **Employee managing their business trips**
   - Editing trip details, flight status
